    <p style = "text-indent : 3em;"> This site is a Senior Capstone project revolving around sentiment analysis on a text corpus that comes from live chat from the site Twitch.tv. Twitch.tv is a live streaming platform where broadcasters can stream content to viewers who can interact with the stream in real time by chatting to other views and clipping portions of gameplay to share on social media. The process of sentiment analysis that we are utilizing is a system by which words and emoticons are given weights and values and then every message is scored. This can then be compounded into an average score for a period of time. We chose to analyse the period of time around the creation of popular clips in order to understand which clips are popular and why. Clips with a high sentiment value are generally more positive and more interactive with the chat wheras low sentiment value clips are often not as popular or have content that is devisive. 
    </p>
    <p style = "text-indent: 3em;"> We give a special thanks to OverRustle and our site supervisor, Rich Thompson. Creators: Jake Heller, Joseph Chan, Yasmine Dana, Hayley Heavlin, and Gwen Hopper. Below is an example of the user Moonmoon and a clip named Pump it Up that was recorded on Twitch.Tv. Displayed is the most common emote that users commented in the chatlog, the number of viewers participated, the rating of the clip by scored by viewers, and the timestamp of the date the clip was recorded. The navigation bar on the left allows users to view all these elements separately.
